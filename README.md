# Scholarship-Management-System

The objective is to streamline and facilitate the scholarship application and awarding process for students in a user-friendly manner. This system aims to provide a seamless and accessible platform where students can easily apply for scholarships and track their application status, while also enabling administrators to efficiently review, evaluate, and allocate scholarships based on predefined criteria. Through this system, we strive to enhance the overall transparency, efficiency, and fairness in the scholarship distribution process, ensuring that deserving students are supported in their educational pursuits and empowered to achieve their academic goals. Developed a scholarship management system ensuring iterative improvement and stakeholder feedback. Utilized Jira for project tracking and management.
